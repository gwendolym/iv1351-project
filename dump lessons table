Run the following query (changing the directory to where you want to put it) to create a text file containing, among
other things, a list of insert statements matching the "lessons" table in the soundgood database. Copy those insert
statements (and just them) and run them in the historical database to insert all the copied data.

pg_dump -U postgres --table lessons --file="C:\Users\isacl\OneDrive\Desktop\KTH\KTH\Data Storage Paradigms\Soundgood\lessonsdump.txt" --column-inserts soundgood
